# React Login/Signup Form

## Description
This project is a simple React-based Login and Signup form with a toggle feature that allows users to switch between the two forms.

### Features:
- A **Login form** with fields for email and password.
- A **Signup form** with fields for email, password, and confirm password.
- Toggle buttons to switch between Login and Signup forms.
- Placeholder links for "Forgot Password?" and "Already a Member?".

## Technology Used
- **React**: For building the UI and managing component states.

## Challenges Faced
1. **Dependency Conflicts**: While setting up the project using `create-react-app`, there were dependency conflicts. This was resolved using the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag.
2. **Module Issues**: Encountered a missing `web-vitals` module error. Fixed this by manually installing the package.
3. **Git Setup**: As a beginner, learning how to initialize Git and push the code to GitHub was challenging but a good learning experience.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
